# Hi, I'm Khalid Ibrahim 👋 
### Software Developer & AI Researcher | Specializing in Music Information Retrieval (MIR)

I am deeply committed to the intersection of **Deep Learning**, **Ethnomusicology**, and **Digital Preservation**. My lifelong mission is to build computational frameworks that protect and celebrate the rich, microtonal traditions of Somali music through modern AI architectures.

---

## 🔭 Current Focus: Qaraami-Gen-AI
I am currently leading research at the **Qaraami-Gen-AI Lab**, where we develop tools for:
- **Automatic Archival Restoration**: Using deep source separation to recover clean Oud stems from vintage Somali cassettes.
- **Microtonal Music Transformers**: Designing custom attention mechanisms for the 5-note Somali pentatonic scale to prevent "Western-bias" in symbolic generation.
- **Interactive Jam Spaces**: Prototyping Human-AI improvisation systems inspired by interaction-driven generative design.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack & Research Toolkit
- **Languages**: Python (Research), TypeScript/JavaScript (Web UI/UX).
- **Deep Learning**: PyTorch, TensorFlow, Transformers, Social Reinforcement Learning.
- **Audio Engineering**: Librosa, Demucs, Spleeter, FFmpeg, Constant-Q Transform (CQT).
- **Data & Backend**: MusicXML, MIDI, FastAPI, PostgreSQL (Neon), Next.js.

## 📈 Recent Research Milestones
- 🎙 **Pre-processing**: Successfully isolated high-fidelity Oud tracks from historical mono-recordings using neural source separation.
- 🎼 **Transcription**: Developing a personalized pitch-tracking system that recognizes neutral notes often "crushed" by standard MIDI systems.
- 🌍 **Community**: Building an open-source corpus of machine-readable Somali microtonal music.
